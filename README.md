#  Project Management & Task Tracking System

A full-stack Project Management and Task Tracking System designed to help me efficiently manage projects, assign tasks, track progress, and meet deadlines.
This project was developed with a focus on clean architecture, usability, and real-world applicability.

## Project Overview

Managing multiple projects and tasks manually can be inefficient and error-prone.  
This system provides a **centralized platform** where users can:

- Create and manage projects
- Assign tasks to users
- Track task status and progress
- Monitor deadlines
- Improve productivity and collaboration

The application follows a **client–server architecture**, separating frontend and backend for scalability and maintainability.
